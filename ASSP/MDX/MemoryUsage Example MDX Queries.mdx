/*
After deploying the ASSP assembly with unrestricted permissions,
run the following code once manually. It creates and populates
a cube database called Memory Usage. This command can take 5
minutes or more to complete depending upon the memory and disk
footprint of the data in your Analysis Services instance.

The data put in the Memory Usage cube comes from the
DISCOVER_MEMORYUSAGE command.
*/
call ASSP.SnapshotMemoryUsageTotals()

/*
Then deploy the reports that are distributed with the ASSP release.
These reports provide helpful views to analyze server memory usage.

Suggestion: Consider creating a job in SQL Agent to execute the
above command on schedule.
