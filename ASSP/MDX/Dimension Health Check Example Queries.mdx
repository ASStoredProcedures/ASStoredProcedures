--The purpose of Dimension Health Check is to check:
-- 1. Checks that attribute relationships hold true according to the data. For
--    instance, if a Subcategory is actually a part of more than one Category, that
--    attribute relationship should not be used. Usually, fixing this problem
--    involves revisiting the definition of the keys for each attribute.
-- 2. Checks the definition of attribute key to determine uniqueness. Particularly,
--    this check determines if a particular key has more than one name. 

--The ListDimensionErrors command returns a dataset which can be consumed by the
--Dimension Health Check report in the ASSP Reports project
--This dataset shows you any problems with the data underlying the dimension
call ASSP.ListDimensionErrors("Geography")

GO

--The ListDimensionsWithErrors function returns a dataset listing the names of
--any dimensions which have health problems
--This function can drive a data-driven subscription in Reporting Services which
--can send out a notification email when there are dimension health problems
call ASSP.ListDimensionsWithErrors()
