-- FindCurrentTuple(). This does pretty much the same as the other functions in the 
-- class except it generates a tuple in the form of a string and it ignores a 
-- hierarchy when the currentmember is the same as the default member, making the 
-- output much more readable. 
-- 
-- includes an optional parameter which is a comma separated list of dimensions or hierarchies
-- exclude from the tuple which is returned 
--
-- LIMITATIONS: it doesn’t work with sets in the WHERE clause, although it could be
--              modified to do so; it won’t work with subselects or calculated 
--              members defined outside the MDX Script
